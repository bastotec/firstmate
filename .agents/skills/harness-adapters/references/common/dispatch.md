# Dispatch and start

Load this with the selected tool reference for dispatch, start, or adapter verification; add `references/common/model-and-effort.md` for either profile axis.

## Resolution

Use the router's detection and safety sections for static crew and secondmate harness resolution and all explicit overrides.
`config/crew-dispatch.json` can override that static default for one crewmate or scout with concrete harness, model, and effort axes.

[`secondmate-provisioning`](../../../secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md) owns inherited local material and its consequences for a secondmate home's worker dispatch.

## Configured profile selection

`../../../AGENTS.md` section 4 keeps the trigger; this section owns the selection procedure.
When dispatch profiles exist, consult them at every crewmate or scout intake and pass the resolved concrete profile required by `fm-spawn`.
Routing precedence is an explicit per-task captain override, then the best-fit configured rule, then the configured default, then the static crewmate harness.
Firstmate alone resolves a matched profile array: begin with `quota-axi`'s default TOON at that intake, using `--json` only when the TOON output is genuinely ambiguous, evaluate every configured candidate against that current output, and choose with inspectable `spendPriority` as the one quota-perspective ranker after checking eligibility, reasoning class, and runway feasibility.
Account for every candidate with the catalog evidence, provider relationship, applicable quota and authentication facts, remaining uncertainty, fit and reasoning class, and the spendPriority and runway evidence used in selection; never omit a candidate, guess, fall back silently, or call the result quota-informed without them.
Establish model support and provider family from that harness's own authoritative catalog, then read `quota-axi` at the granularity the vendor actually supplies: provider-level or all-model evidence applies to every model established in that family, and a named-model window bounds only that model.
Missing model-level quota, a missing authentication source, unmeasurable headroom, or unmodeled authentication is disclosed uncertainty that keeps a candidate eligible, never a credential or login escalation.
Only concrete contradictory evidence blocks a candidate, such as an authoritative catalog proving the model unsupported or proof that the credential selected for that surface is unusable; never infer a credential store, provider family, or quota mapping from a harness, model, or source name, and never launch another harness's CLI to judge a candidate.
Preserve malformed profile configuration as an actionable error rather than selecting around it.
When every candidate is tight, preserve the captain's strongest-reasoning class rather than silently downgrading it solely to conserve quota; stop and report the tight choice if that class cannot proceed.
Break genuine evidence ties without array-order or harness bias.
`quota-axi` owns how model or product windows relate to bounding account windows and remains data-only.

## Owners

`../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` owns launch, autonomy, concrete flags, task-kind compatibility, and worker turn-end wiring.
Natural-language rules stay with firstmate, while scripts receive concrete axes.

`../../../bin/fm-busy-lib.sh` owns semantic busy trust.
Composer shapes, glyphs, placeholders, popups, rendered delivery signals, and the `empty` / `pending` / `pending-unproven` / `unknown` decision belong only to `../../../bin/fm-composer-lib.sh`.
Tool references record empirical knowledge for those executable owners.

## Adapter verification

For an approved new adapter check, use the spawn owner's raw-launch escape hatch only for a trivial supervised task.
Verify detection in `../../../bin/fm-harness.sh`, launch in `../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh`, busy state in `../../../bin/fm-busy-lib.sh`, shared composer behavior in `../../../bin/fm-composer-lib.sh`, lifecycle in `../../../bin/fm-control-lib.sh`, and endpoint liveness in `../../../bin/backends/stream.sh`.
Also verify primary integration through `references/common/primary-hooks.md`, model discovery through `references/common/model-and-effort.md`, and one tool record.
A value remains unreachable until its executable owner, portable regression, applicable credentialed live guard, and verification record land together.
`../firstmate-coding-guidelines/SKILL.md` owns harness-dependent proof.
