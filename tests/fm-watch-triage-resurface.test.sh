# --- quiet pane, worktree still being written: deferred, never wedge-escalated -
# The live 2026-08-14 case: one crew produced eight consecutive possible-wedge
# escalations in an afternoon, three of them demanding deep inspection, while it
# was demonstrably writing source, then tests, then documentation. The detector's
# two inputs (pane quietness, run step) cannot see that, so the pane looks frozen.
# Both halves of the contract are asserted on the SAME fixture, because the whole
# point is that only the worktree evidence differs: writing defers, silent
# escalates on the unchanged schedule.
# Every wait below is the file's standard one (wait_poll_cycle for an absorbing
# watcher, a 100-tick wait_for_exit for an escalating one), because the poll these
# tests assert on is the ONE poll that spawns the bounded worktree walk: on a
# loaded runner it outlives a fixed liveness budget, and a round reaped before it
# finished reports a lost deferral instead of the deferral under test.
