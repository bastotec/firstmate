#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/watch-triage-helpers.sh - shared fixtures for the wake-triage suites,
# tests/fm-watch-triage*.test.sh. Those suites cover the always-on wake triage
# built into bin/fm-watch.sh and the shared classifier (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh).
# The watcher absorbs the benign majority of wakes in bash and exits ONLY on an
# actionable wake, so firstmate's LLM re-arms once per actionable event instead
# of once per wake. The suites cover the classifier predicates as pure
# functions, then drive a real fm-watch.sh subprocess to assert the behavioral
# contract: provably-working no-verb wakes absorbed (no exit, no queue entry,
# suppressor advanced, beacon fresh), stopped-crew no-verb wakes surfaced (queue
# + exit), provably-working stale panes absorbed-then-escalated past the
# threshold, terminal-looking stale status lines overridden by an active run,
# the heartbeat backstop fail-safe, and afk coherence (no double-triage while
# the away-mode daemon owns supervision).
#
# They were one file until its run time set the floor for every CI shard, so
# the cases are split by topic into separate suites that can run on separate
# workers. Every case lives in exactly one suite; this file holds only the
# helpers they share.
#
# Daemon-side classification/injection lives in fm-daemon.test.sh; watcher/lock
# liveness in fm-watcher-lock.test.sh; the durable-queue safety matrix in
# fm-wake-queue.test.sh.

# --- work the captain is already holding: pane churn must not re-alarm -------
# The other record of a legitimate wait. The declared-wait bound above reads the
# status LINE, and a delivered task's line stays `done: PR ...` while the wait
# itself lives in the BACKLOG, written there by bin/fm-captain-hold.sh. No line
# predicate can see that record, so both stale alarms - the captain-relevant one
# and the inconclusive one - re-fired on every new pane hash for as long as the
# captain was deciding, which is the 2026-09 loop observed on delivered work
# awaiting their merge word.
# Pinned here, in both directions: while the call stands the first sight still
# alarms, further sights of the SAME call and status-log state are absorbed, and
# a new pane hash after the window's end alarms once more; and the identical
# fixture WITHOUT the hold keeps alarming on every hash, because a bound that
# swallowed an unheld delivery or blocker would be worse than the churn it removes.
#
# The backlog is real rather than a fixture file: bin/fm-captain-hold.sh is the
# only writer of a hold and tasks-axi the only reader, so a hand-written row
# would pin this test's idea of a hold instead of the one the watcher consults.
#
# Cost: every case below drives churn through ONE watcher process rather than
# relaunching per pane change. Watcher startup dominates a round here, and an
# absorbing watcher stays in its poll loop across churn in production anyway, so
# the cheaper shape is also the more faithful one.
