# --- a live worker parked on a declared wait: pane churn must not re-alarm ----
# The 2026-08/09 alarm loop, in both observed forms - a worker parked on the
# CAPTAIN (captain-held, five consecutive alarms) and one parked on the PIPELINE
# (paused:, dozens across one day). pause_state_class deliberately returns `none`
# for either while the agent is still ALIVE, so that a worker genuinely waiting on
# a decision is never silenced; first sight of each distinct stale hash therefore
# reaches surface_nonterminal_stale. An idle parked pane still churns its hash (a
# clock, a token counter), so every tick used to re-enter that first-sight path and
# wake firstmate - the throttle was written by the very wake it should have
# prevented, and the hash-change path cleared it again before it was ever read.
# The contract pinned here: the FIRST sight still surfaces, further sights inside
# PAUSE_RESURFACE_SECS are absorbed, and the window's end still re-surfaces once,
# so a forgotten wait cannot rot invisibly.
