# fm-test-run.sh - single owner of Firstmate's behavior-test runner, lane
# composition for portable CI shards, local --jobs for proven-concurrent work,
# timing markers, and the complete-regression coverage guard.
#
# Selection modes (exactly one of: --all, --family, --changed, --lane,
# --proven-isolated, or script paths):
#   fm-test-run.sh --all
#   fm-test-run.sh --family <name>
#   fm-test-run.sh --changed [--base <git-ref>]
#   fm-test-run.sh --lane portable-parallel-1|portable-parallel-2|portable-serial
#   fm-test-run.sh --lane portable-serial-<k>of<n>   (one CI serial shard)
#   fm-test-run.sh --proven-isolated
#   fm-test-run.sh tests/<name>.test.sh [more scripts...]
#
# Inspection (no execution):
#   fm-test-run.sh --list --all
#   fm-test-run.sh --list --family <name>
#   fm-test-run.sh --list --lane portable-parallel-1
#   fm-test-run.sh --list-scheduled --family <name>
#   fm-test-run.sh --list-scheduled --lane portable-parallel-1

#   fm-test-run.sh --list-concurrent-safe-families
#   fm-test-run.sh --concurrent-safe-family-jobs-max <name>
#   fm-test-run.sh --list-lanes
#   fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage
#
# Aggregation (no suite execution):
#   fm-test-run.sh --aggregate-json <out.json> <lane.json> [more lane.json...]
#
# Options:
#   --json <path>   write a deterministic timing artifact after the run. Each
#                   script record carries its family, expected gate-skip class,
#                   exit, duration, whether it gate-skipped, and the reason it
#                   gave (empty when it ran), so a lane can say which harness or
#                   tool this host could not exercise.
#   --list          print selected script paths (one per line) and exit 0
#   --list-scheduled
#                   print selected paths longest-hint-first and exit 0.
#                   Only --lane portable-parallel-1 or portable-parallel-2 and
#                   --proven-isolated use parallel hints, falling back to
#                   serial weights if missing. Every other selection uses
#                   serial weights alone. A concurrent run starts its scripts
#                   in this same order.
#                   Equal weights are ordered by path under LC_ALL=C.
#   --base <ref>    with --changed, compare against this ref (default: origin/main)
#   --exclude-family <name>
#                   drop scripts whose primary family matches <name> after selection
#                   (repeatable; portable CI lanes exclude real-herdr-gated so the
#                   dedicated required Herdr lane owns that coverage)
#   --fail-on-gate-skip <token>
#                   after each script, fail the run if any output line contains
#                   "skip: <token>" (e.g. --fail-on-gate-skip 'herdr not found').
#                   The required Herdr CI lane uses this so a missing pin cannot
#                   silently pass as a gate skip.
#   --jobs N        run the selected scripts with up to N concurrent workers.
#                   Plain --changed and a plain list of script paths use
#                   min(4, cpus) workers when multiple selected scripts are
#                   admissible; --lane, --family, and --all stay serial unless
#                   asked for concurrency explicitly. The one exception is a
#                   CI serial shard (portable-serial-<k>of<n>), which runs its
#                   admitted families in phases of PORTABLE_SERIAL_PHASE_JOBS
#                   workers and its unproven scripts serially after them;
#                   --jobs 1 keeps such a shard fully serial.
#                   N>1 is allowed only when every selected script is proven
#                   safe to run concurrently: individually in the proven-isolated
#                   set (bin/fm-test-isolation-proof.sh --list), or in a family
#                   carrying a recorded concurrent proof
#                   (list_concurrent_safe_families below). Overall cap is 8;
#                   family proofs may impose a lower cap. Individually proven
#                   scripts share one phase; scripts admitted only by a family
#                   proof run in a separate phase for each family. Concurrent
#                   phases use serial weights, longest-hint-first. Unproven stateful
#                   scripts run serially after all concurrent phases. Default is
#                   1 (serial) except for plain --changed and a plain list of
#                   script paths, which use the bounded automatic scheduler.
#   --per-script-timeout-secs N
#                   terminate a script that runs longer than N seconds and
#                   record it as exit 124 (0 disables, the default). The
#                   --changed applies 900s automatically as a per-script hang
#                   tripwire, not a speed control. --max-wall-ms is checked
#                   after the run and so cannot catch a hang on its own.
#                   External interruption cleanup is outside this runner's
#                   guarantee; configured per-script bounds remain authoritative.
#   --max-wall-ms N fail the run when its measured invocation wall clock exceeds
#                   N milliseconds, including an empty selection. It is
#                   evaluated after selection and suite execution and cannot
#                   interrupt a running script; per-script hangs are
#                   bounded by --per-script-timeout-secs. Pathological output
#                   sinks that block finalization are explicitly out of scope.

#
# Placement refusal:
#   A task worker is assigned an isolated worktree, and that placement is
#   checked only when its task starts. When FM_TASK_ID marks such a worker and
#   this runner resolves to the repository's PRIMARY checkout, every executing
#   mode refuses before selecting a suite: the suite creates and switches
#   branches, and the primary is the checkout every linked worktree resolves
#   against. Inspection modes execute nothing and stay available, and a run with
#   no FM_TASK_ID set is unchanged.
#
# Exit status is non-zero if any selected script exits non-zero, a configured
# --fail-on-gate-skip token appears, the measured duration exceeds
# --max-wall-ms, timing-artifact finalization fails, or a concurrent worker
# violates its isolation check. Other gate skips (first meaningful line
# matching ^skip:) remain successful and are counted as skipped_gate; each one
# is logged with its reason and recorded in the timing artifact.
#
# expected_gate_skip classes name why a family is allowed to skip: herdr (the
# pinned real-Herdr lane), optional-binary (a backend whose binary is optional),
# live-capability (a live-harness guard governed by fm_live_gate, which records
# unavailable tools and explicit policy skips; see tests/lib.sh), or none.
#
# Every selected script runs isolated from the host's global and system Git
# configuration, including one that sources no test helper of its own;
# tests/git-config-helpers.sh owns that contract and its limits.
#
# Family labels, the changed-file map, and production portable-shard composition
# live in this script only (one owner). The proven-isolated candidate set remains
# owned by bin/fm-test-isolation-proof.sh; portable parallel shards are a
# duration-balanced partition of that exact set, packed from the measured hints
# in portable_parallel_weight_hints (see docs/fm-test-portable-shards.md).
# --check-coverage reports parallel_max_ms (the larger lane hint sum),
# parallel_imbalance_ms (the absolute difference between the sums), and
# parallel_unhinted (the number of members missing a parallel hint).
# These sums exclude unhinted members and are estimates, not measured job wall
# times. Missing parallel hints are reported without failing this guard.
#
# portable-serial itself stays strictly serial. Its CI shards
# (portable-serial-<k>of<n>) split it across separate runners, and inside one
# shard only members of a family with a recorded concurrent proof share the
# machine, with each other, in that family's own phase; every unproven script
# runs alone after the phases. The shards are packed on that phase model
# (portable_serial_assignments). This script owns <n> and the phase worker
# count: a lane whose <n> disagrees with the configured shard count is refused,
# so a CI matrix cannot silently drop a shard.
# --changed is conservative: it over-selects related families rather than
# under-selecting, and never expands to the complete suite unless --all. The one
# place it is deliberately narrow is a bin/ path with no curated family: a test
# that names it is selected as that SCRIPT, because the reference is per-script
# evidence. Consumer bin/ scripts still resolve through the curated map, so
# recorded family-level coupling still expands to the whole family.
# tests/lib.sh, tests/fixtures.sh, tests/*-helpers.sh and tests/*-fixture.sh are
# shared files that map to the suites naming them; a fixture under
# tests/fixtures/<dir>/ is mapped by that directory instead. Curated family arms
# above those also name individual tests/ files explicitly.
